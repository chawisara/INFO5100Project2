# INFO5100Project2

How to run:
- If you use Google Chrome, you have to run index.html on a server for the maps and graphs to load.
- If you use Firefox or other web browsers, you should get it working just by opening the index.html file from the project folder.

Interactive features:
- Pokemon details: hover on a Pokemon on the map to see its stats
- Map interactions: click on the magnifying glass icons to zoom-in/out the map; drag the map around using your mouse to pan around
- "Show all Pokemons" button: click to clear all the filters and show all the Pokemons available in NYC; this is the default state that the web displays when it's initially loaded
- Pokemon search: type in the name of the Pokemon you want to be displayed on the map and hit "Enter" or click on the "Search" button; the search will display the Pokemon's locations at all periods of time unless the user applies the time and/or weather filter to the map 
- Weather filter: click on the weather icon for the map to only show the Pokemons available in a certain weather
- Time filter: drag the slider to change the time and see only the Pokemonos that are available during a certain period of time
- Gym battle: drag any 2 Pokemons on the map to the bottom-left corner box with the "VS" icon to activate a pop-up comparing the Pokemons' battle stats and suggesting which one is more likely to win in the battle

*Note that the time and weather filters overlap if they are being applied to the map simultaneously without any clearing
